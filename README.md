🚀 **About Me**  
I'm a passionate **Generative AI Engineer** with strong roots in **Prompt Engineering**, **LLM Evaluation**, and **Data Annotation**. I’ve worked on multiple production-level AI tasks—ranging from **meta-prompting and LLM agents** to **evaluating multilingual model responses** and **training models for real-world use cases**.  

💼 As a **Freelancer**, I’ve contributed to global projects focusing on:
- Generative AI, Prompt Engineering
- Multi-turn and single-turn LLM response grading  
- High-quality prompt engineering for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models  
- Preference ranking, data augmentation, classification & annotation  
- RLHF-based tuning, and generative image/text tasks, Vision-Language Models(VLMs)
